# BlueSCSI-SE-bracket
SVG design for a bracket to hold a BlueSCSI 1.1 in the expansion bay door of the Macintosh SE computer series, so that the BlueSCSI SD card is easily removable. 

The bracket SVG file can be used by any laser cutter using any 1/8‚Äù (~3mm) material. I use hardwood for the artistic grain, but acrylic, plywood, or MDF will work well too.

The faceplate SVG file can be used by any by use by any laser cutter using any 2/100" (~.5mm) material. I use wood veneer backed with 3M tape, but you could use a different material and affix the faceplate to the bracket with an adhesive.
